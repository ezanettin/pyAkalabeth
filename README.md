# pyAkalabeth
Python port of the Apple II game Akalabeth by Richard Garriott

This is my Python3 port of Akalabeth, based on the code presented by https://github.com/videogamepreservation/akalabeth.
It all started as a line-by-line port from Applesoft BASIC to Python3, but I got tired of that pretty quick. Still, I'm an amateur with Python, so don't expect great code.
