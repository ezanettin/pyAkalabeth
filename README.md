# pyAkalabeth
Python port of the Apple II game Akalabeth by Richard Garriott (1979)

This is my Python3 port of Akalabeth, based on the code presented by https://github.com/videogamepreservation/akalabeth.
It all started as a line-by-line port from Applesoft BASIC to Python3, but I got tired of that pretty quick. I eventually figured that an Applesoft abstraction layer would be really helpful. Better late than never. But, I'm an amateur with Python, so don't expect great code.

The Apple II font file, PrintChar21.tff was taken from https://www.kreativekorp.com/software/fonts/apple2/.

Requires PyGame Python library.
